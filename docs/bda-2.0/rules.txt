* BDA 2.0 assumptions
** All deployments will be DAC if not using DAC, not using bda-2.0
** Each container will be installed on it's server (jboss on jboss server, db on db server, tomcat on tomcat server)
*** Deploy folder will inlcude container name ($HOME/deploy/db)

* Features of engine
** Logging capability like log4j
** Try to add ant listener like functionality that can track each event.

* Coding standards
** Log debug on entry and exit of each "code block"
** Report event to "listener" on entry and exit of each "code block"

* Database
** env.name=local - re-create
** env.name=external - ??
** env.name=other - drop schema

* Disable
** If disable is chosen for a step then the properties are not required.
